    "            - For example, a February report contains users who had an email delivery or registration date between September 1st (4 months before Jan 1st, the start of relevant holdout period) to February 28th (end of reporting period).\n",
    "        - Justification: Email deliveries may leave impression on users, leaving the intended effect of marketing. New users are sent emails, so they are included in measurement. 4 month period chosen to minimize impact of communication blackout due to previous holdout.\n",
    "    - Viewing winback definition restricted to 30 to 90 day window in both numerator and denominator. Previous version numerator had no restriction\n",
    "    - Paid churn definition changed from end of previous reporting month's cohort to end of current reporting month's cohort"
